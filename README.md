# Climate_change_impact_in_solarPV_output
This project is written to complete my thesis final defense.  I am still working on it, so there must be any updates for codes as well as the analysis. If you guys are interested, any comments or insights will be a great help. 

In this project, I'm working with CMIP6 dataset (such as rsds, rsdt, tas, etc) to analyze solar PV output over Indonesia region. A deep learning model will be used to produce high-resolution daily solar radiation data for historical and future period. 

## Data Collection
- Reference data
- Climate model data


## Data Processing
- Clearness index calculation
- Daylight hours estimation
- Bias-correction techniques for daily surface solar radiation and daytime near-surface temperature
- Solar Photovoltaic (PV) power estimation (historical & future)
 

## Data Analysis
- Evaluate model performance in the baseline period
- Calculate Future Changes in PV energy potential
- Perform a trend analysis


## Findings & Discussions


## Summary
