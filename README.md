# Climate Change Impact in Solar PV Output over Indonesia
This project is written to complete my thesis final defense.  I am still working on it, so there must be any updates for codes as well as the analysis. If you guys are interested, any comments or insights will be a great help. 

In this project, I'm working with several climate variables from CMIP6 dataset (such as solar radiation downard/GHI, near-surface temperature, cloud cover, etc.) under two future scenarios to analyze solar PV output over Indonesia. A deep learning model will be used to produce high-resolution daily energy potential of solar PV for historical and future period (upt to 2100).
